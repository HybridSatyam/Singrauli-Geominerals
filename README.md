🚜 Equipment Performance & Fuel Analytics Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard is a custom MES-style solution built to solve a real problem in mining.

📊 Key Features:

Production Monitoring: Total production visualized per shift, highlighting peak and low performance times.

Fuel Consumption Analysis: Track total fuel usage with litres/hour breakdown across all the equipments.

Shift-Wise Status: Visual breakdown of activity by shift (A, B, C) showing trips and machine engagement.

Downtime Analysis: Identify causes and distribution of equipment downtime to improve machine availability.

Efficiency Tracker: Compare equipment efficiency scores to identify top and underperformers.

Key Influencers: Uses machine learning insights to explain factors impacting fuel consumption (e.g., trip category, efficiency drop).

🧠 Insights Derived:

Shift B underperforms in production compared to A and C.

Fuel efficiency varies slightly across equipment, with CRD-05 showing relatively lower efficiency.

Long trip categories and low tonnage per trip significantly increase fuel usage.


🔧 Tech Stack:

Power BI
DAX for Measures & KPIs
Dynamic Filtering by Equipment, Date, and Shift



ℹ️ Project Notes

💡 Inspiration: Initial dashboard layout concept was inspired by a YouTube tutorial and later extensively customized to align with specific KPIs relevant to mining operations.

🏢 Company Name: "Singrauli Geominerals" is a fictional entity, chosen because I belong to the mining-rich region of Singrauli and have firsthand experience working in mines.

🔖 Motto: "Fueling the future" is an original tagline added to give the dashboard a professional brand feel.

📊 Data Authenticity: While the structure and parameters (e.g., fuel consumption, equipment metrics) reflect real-world scenarios, the actual values have been artificially generated using ChatGPT to avoid any copyright or proprietary data issues.

✅ No Copyright Infringement: All visualizations, names, and data used in this project are either original or modified enough to ensure compliance with copyright policies.



🧮 Technical Highlights

⚙️ Dynamic Conditional Formatting (DAX):
In the Litres per Hour visual, DAX logic is implemented to highlight values in red if fuel consumption exceeds a threshold of 50 Ltr/Hrs, helping users quickly identify inefficiencies.


🚧 Problem Statement & Uniqueness

🛠️ Real-World Challenge: Mining operations often rely on basic dashboards with simple tables or bar charts.

📉 Gap in Industry Practice: Despite the availability of raw data, such dynamic dashboards are rarely implemented in actual mine sites.

🌟 Innovative Solution: This dashboard proposes visualization framework tailored for mining operations, providing actionable insights.



💻 System Used: Developed on a HP Pavilion 14-dv2053TU — a powerful and reliable machine.
